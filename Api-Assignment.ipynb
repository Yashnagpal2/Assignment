    "Consider a weather forecasting application on your smartphone. This application likely retrieves weather data from a remote server owned by a weather service provider. The weather service provider's server exposes a weather data API. The smartphone app sends requests to this API, specifying the location and time for which it wants weather information. The API processes the request, accesses the necessary data, and sends the weather information back to the app. In this case, the API acts as an intermediary, allowing the weather app to access and display up-to-date weather data from the weather service provider's server."
