    "Templates in Flask are a way to separate the HTML structure and presentation from the Python code in your web application. They allow you to create dynamic web pages by embedding placeholders for data that will be filled in when the page is rendered. This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and update the user interface of your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why templates are used in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: Templates separate the presentation layer (HTML) from the logic layer (Python code). This separation makes your code more organized and maintainable, as changes to the HTML won't require changes in the Python code and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Content: Templates enable you to inject dynamic content into web pages. You can pass data from your Flask application to the template, and the template engine will render the data in the appropriate places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Templates can be reused across multiple pages of your website. You can create a base template with a common layout and then extend it or include it in other templates to maintain a consistent design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: HTML embedded within Python code can be hard to read and maintain. Templates use a more natural and structured approach to define the layout of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render templates and generate HTML responses. It takes the name of the template file as an argument and can also accept additional variables to pass data to the template. Here's why render_template() is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rendering Templates: render_template() is the primary method for rendering templates in Flask. It processes the specified template file and replaces placeholders with the provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing Data: You can pass data from your Python code (e.g., variables, lists, dictionaries) to the template using render_template(). This data can be dynamically displayed in the rendered HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Template Lookup: Flask automatically looks for template files in a predefined templates folder (usually named \"templates\" by convention). You only need to provide the template's filename, and Flask will locate and render it."
